#       Ye workflow daily run karega (cron: '0 0 * * *' â†’ har din raat ke 12 baje UTC par).

# Issues aur PRs ko stale mark karega agar 30 din tak koi activity nahi hoti.

# Agar 10 din tak aur activity nahi hoti, toh issue ya PR close kar diya jayega.

# Agar kisi issue ya PR par "bug", "wip", ya "on-hold" label laga ho toh usse stale nahi mark karega.

# Agar ek PR stale hone ke baad close ho jaye, toh uski branch automatically delete ho jayegi.


# Sandbox Org me ek repo banega (terraform-shared-workflows)

# Ye repo shared workflows store karega (stale issues & stale PRs)

# Jo bhi Terraform module repos hai, wo shared workflows ko call kar sakenge

# Agar future me changes chahiye, sirf shared repo update karna hoga (baaki repositories automatically latest version use karengi)
